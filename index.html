			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<br class="solidLine">
			<p>I moved to North Carolina when I was 13 and immediately fell in love with the state. I can have just as much fun hiking in the mountains during that fall as I can swimming in the ocean during the summer.Even after 18 years here, I haven't come close to experiencing everything the state has to offer.</p>
			<p>I got into programming while I was working as a tech analyst at UNC. We were allowed to take two free UNC courses a year as an employee benefit and I chose a couple courses in the Computer Science department. The challenge was totally new, and the payoff of successfully coding was unlike any feeling I'd experienced before. I decided recently it was time to pursue this new found passion, which brought me to the UNC Coding Boot Camp.</p>
